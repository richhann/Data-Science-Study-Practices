# Reflective Report on Portfolio 2

## Introduction

This report outlines the experiences and learning while working on Portfolio 2 of the [Data Science Study Practices](https://github.com/richhann/Data-Science-Study-Practices/tree/portfolio-part-2-richhann) on GitHub. The core focus was on analyzing a chosen dataset using various machine learning models, particularly exploring the efficacy of Linear Regression models.

## Problem Solving and Learning

The primary challenges faced during this project were data preprocessing and model selection. Through diligent research and collaborative discussions, I managed to overcome these challenges. The process enriched my understanding of machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, particularly the importance of feature selection and the impact of training data size on model performance.

## Progression and Future Interests

The progression from the beginning of this unit to the completion of Portfolio 2 has been notable. Practical exposure to real-world data and the hands-on application of theoretical knowledge significantly enhanced my confidence and proficiency in data science. Moving forward, I am eager to explore non-linear models and delve into more complex datasets to tackle intricate problems.

## Discussion Points

### Dataset Choice
The dataset for Portfolio 2 was chosen due to its potential for exploring [provide a brief description of the dataset and its relevance to your project].

### Problem Identification
The primary problem identified was the evaluation of different Linear Regression models to understand their performance based on MSE and RMSE.

### Model Selection
Four different models were evaluated, each varying in feature selection and training data size. The objective was to understand the impact of these variables on model performance.

### Insights and Conclusions
The expectation was that a model trained with the most correlated features and more training data would yield better results. However, the results indicated no significant difference in performance across the models, as reflected in the MSE and RMSE values. It was also observed that the amount of data slightly impacted the helpfulness of reviews, although the high MSE suggested that the models were not very accurate within a 1 out of 5 rating system. The analysis concluded that Linear Regression might not be the most suitable model for this task, hinting at a possible non-linear relationship among features. 

## Additional Points
The project hinted at the existence of non-linear relationships between some features, which may require exploring non-linear models in future projects. The suggestion to consider different feature combinations, especially when gender and category features are mixed, could potentially lead to better model performance.
