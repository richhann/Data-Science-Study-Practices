# Reflective Report on Portfolio 4

## Introduction

This report encapsulates the exploration journey undertaken in Portfolio 4 of the [Data Science Study Practices](https://github.com/richhann/Data-Science-Study-Practices/tree/portfolio-part-4-richhann) on GitHub. The focal point of this project was to unravel the economic ramifications of COVID-19, its linkage with stock market oscillations, specifically zooming into Bitcoin and S&P 500 indices, and the influence of USA governmental stimulus packages on these markets.

## Problem Solving and Learning

The project posed a multi-faceted challenge, encompassing data procurement from diverse sources, handling missing or incomplete data, and aligning the data chronologically to reflect accurate trends. Through rigorous data preparation and exploration, I honed my skills in variable identification, univariate and bivariate analysis, which were pivotal in the subsequent analysis phase.

## Progression and Future Interests

The progression from the onset of this unit to the culmination of Portfolio 4 has been enriching. The project not only fortified my data analysis acumen but also spurred a keen interest in economic data analysis, which I am eager to delve into deeper in future projects.

## Discussion Points

### Dataset Choice
The datasets encompassed stock market data from Yahoo Finance and Wall Street Journal, Bitcoin data from Yahoo Finance, COVID-19 data from Kaggle or World Health Organization, and Government Stimulus Packages data from Investopedia. These were instrumental in constructing a well-rounded analysis of the economic landscape during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Problem Identification
The project sought to answer well-defined questions concerning the global economic impact of COVID-19, the correlation between COVID-19 cases and stock market indices, the effect of government stimulus packages on stock market indices and Bitcoin prices, and the correlation between stimulus packages' release timelines with Bitcoin and S&P 500 indices.

### Model Selection
Employing Correlation Analysis, Time Series Analysis, and Regression Analysis was pivotal in dissecting the relationships between the variables and predicting the impact of various factors on stock market indices and Bitcoin prices.

### Insights and Conclusions
The juxtaposition of Bitcoin versus S&P 500 unveiled nuanced insights into market behaviors in response to governmental economic interventions during the pandemic. The correlation analysis between stimulus packages, Bitcoin, and the S&P 500 offered a lens into different market reactions, thus fulfilling the objective of providing a thorough analysis addressing the core requisites of the project.

## Additional Points
The project underscored the significance of a structured analysis framework, clear documentation, and the power of visualization in conveying complex data insights. The endeavor into creating interactive dashboards for deeper data exploration was a learning curve that added a robust dimension to the analysis.
