- Package 3 March 27, 2020 largest relief package (Additional 600 USD/week)

- Package 3.5 April 24, 2020

- Package 4 Dec. 21, 2020, 900 billion stimulus

- Package 5 March 11, 2021 implementing a 1.9 trillion package

### Proposing Well-defined Questions (2 marks)

1. What has been the global economic impact of COVID-19?
2. Is there a correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and stock market indices across different countries?
3. Have government stimulus packages had a positive impact on stock market indices and Bitcoin prices?
4. How do stimulus packages' release timelines correlate with Bitcoin and S&P 500 indices?

### Data Preparation and Exploration (2 marks)

#### Data Sources:

- **Stock Market Data**: Yahoo Finance, Wall Street Journal.
- **Bitcoin Data**: Historical price data from Yahoo Finance.
- **COVID-19 Data**: Datasets available on Kaggle or data from the World Health Organization.
- **Government Stimulus Packages**: Investopedia US COVID-19 Stimulus and Relief Accessed: 16/10/2023.

#### Exploration:
- **Variable Identification**: Identify the variables within each dataset and their types.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyze single variables to understand their distribution and potential impact.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Analyze the relationships between COVID-19 cases, stock market indices, Bitcoin prices, and stimulus packages.
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Handle missing or incomplete data to ensure accuracy in analysis.

### Analysis/Prediction Techniques (2 marks)
- **Correlation Analysis**: Assess the correlation between COVID-19 cases, stock market indices, Bitcoin prices, and stimulus package timelines.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Explore stock market, Bitcoin trends over time, and relate them to major COVID-19 events or stimulus package announcements.
- **Regression Analysis**: Determine the impact of various factors on stock market indices and Bitcoin prices.

### Visualization (2 marks)
- Visualize the global economic impact of COVID-19 using geographic heatmaps or time-series plots.
- Utilize scatter plots or line charts to visualize the correlation between COVID-19 cases, stock market indices, Bitcoin prices, and stimulus package timelines.
- Create interactive dashboards that allow for a deeper exploration of data and insights.

### Evaluation
- Evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of your models using metrics like MSE, MAE, R-squared for regression problems, and accuracy, F-score, AUC for classification problems.
- Compare the performance of simpler models with more complex models to show improvement.
- Conduct parameter analysis to optimize model performance, e.g., tuning the k parameter in KNN algorithm.

### Implementation
- Implement your analysis in a structured notebook, with clear explanations, visualizations, and code.
- Ensure your data, analysis, and findings are well-documented and shared on GitHub as instructed.
- Submit a backup version of your completed notebook on iLearn as instructed.

## Focus and Rationale
- The focus on Bitcoin versus S&P 500 provides a more nuanced understanding as stocks may be impacted due to the company's profitability and dividend yield, whereas Bitcoin is largely driven by investor confidence.
- By analyzing the correlation between stimulus packages, Bitcoin, and the S&P 500, this report aims to provide insights into different market behaviors in response to governmental economic interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Conclusion
In this project, we aim to create a thorough analysis to address the core requirements while also investigating the economic implications of COVID-19, its relationship with stock market indices, Bitcoin prices, and the impact of governmental stimulus packages.
